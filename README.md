## VFriend - Your Virtual Friends

VFriend is an app that allows you to create virtual characters (friends or family) that you cannot talk to for various reasons (such as passing away or not having contact information). Using the OpenAI API, you can create a virtual friend that can converse with you in a natural language. The app is built using React Native and Expo, and it utilizes Firebase Firestore to store the characters' information and chat history.
Functionality

VFriend allows users to create virtual characters and chat with them using natural language. The app utilizes the OpenAI API to generate responses from the virtual friend, making the conversation feel more real. Users can also store information about their virtual characters, such as name, photo, and interests, in Firebase Firestore.

## Configuration
To run this app, you will need to have your OpenAI API key and create an **apikey.js** file under the OpenAI folder with your own API key. Additionally, you will need to create a Firebase project and set it up as a web app. Then, copy the configuration data and create **firebaseConfig.js **under the Firebase folder with your data.
